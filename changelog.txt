WOZBOXNTV 1.0.21 www.wozboxtv.com
# This version i based on the original NTV AddOn 3.3.9 from Mickey1234 with additions for version 3.4.1 - 3.4.8 and v3.4.4-Krogsbell
# The basic problem with NTV.mx is that you are only allowed to use one channel at a time, either from Web og XBMC/Kodi. If you have the MAG250 option, it has its own channel. You can watch films on the Web without interrupting the use of the the NTV.mx AddOn on XBMC/Kodi.
# This version will help you to record channels and watch channels without interrupting an active channel.
# This version is delivered as a ZIP file that you can install manually. It can run in parallel with the original NTV.mx AddOn, but remember that you can only use one channel at at time.
# This version has been tested with Kodi 16.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 x64, OpenELEC x32 5.0.8, OpenELEC x64 6.0.0, Windows and Google TV with Android 4.4.2
#
# WARNING - This addon do not care about Daylight Savings. All timing is incremental. To avoid problems - restart your KODI when Daylight Saving has changed and if you change your timezone!
# Some TV Guides do not take care of your timezone offset - This can be adjutse in the recording setup.
#
# NOTE Recursive search uses SQL statement by adding % in front and at the end. If you add % in the middle you can find e.g. 'Recursive: Formel%Løbet' will find something like 'Formel 1: Ruslands Grand Prix  Løbet'
#
# NOTE to Addroid users:
# To record on Android you must copy ffmpeg from ../plugin.video.wozboxntv/ffmpeg/android/armeabi-v7a/ffmpeg to /vendor/bin/ffmpeg
# Then set the execute flag on /vendor/bin/ffmpeg
# Another option is to use rtmpdump:
# Android recording working, but do not stop as expected when using rtmpdump
# To record on Android you must copy two files in the addon subfolder ../rtmpdump/androidarm to /vendor/bin/rtmpdump and /vendor/lib/librtmp.so
# Then set the execute flag on /vendor/bin/rtmpdump
#
# Please report your working platform as shown on the Recordings page of the settings together with the setting that is needed to have recording work on your platform. With this inforation, the setup of recording wil be automatic for your platform!
#
# If your recording fails and the recording is placed in several files you can put the files together on an Ubuntu system with theese simple commands:
# Move all the files to a seperate folder and run this commandon each of the parts:
# ffmpeg -i INCOMING.(FLV/MP4) -vcodec copy -acodec copy VIDEO_(01,02).mkv
# Ex:
# ffmpeg -i *].flv -vcodec copy -acodec copy 0.flv
# ffmpeg -i *1.flv -vcodec copy -acodec copy 1.flv
# ffmpeg -i *2.flv -vcodec copy -acodec copy 2.flv
# then:
# mkvmerge -o FULL_VIDEO.mkv VIDEO_01.mkv +VIDEO_02.mkv +VIDEO_03.mkv
# Ex:
# mkvmerge -o FULL_VIDEO.flv 0.flv +1.flv +2.flv
# Then rename FULL_VIDEO.flv to [Original videoname]FULL_VIDEO.flv
# Results can vary depending on your source files!
#
# Krogsbell changes:
# 2016-05-06 When updating channels in your TV Guide - the SQL file can actually set the prefered channel in the TV Guide to your NTV channel - look at the file SQLadjustTVguideExample.sql in this program folder. It sets 15 DK channels when using Rytec Danish EPG (Note to force a change you have to modify the first line to point to another channel - e.g change DR1 to DR2 and back when you are satisfied)

# 2016-04-26 Add Time Zone Offset to time from TV Guide to adjust changed timezone
#            Time Zone offset in Hours (e.g. CET --> Greece set to 1)

# 2016-04-21 Log when waiting to select NTV Channel for TV Guide channel not mapped automatically
# 2016-04-18 Debug CatFromChannelName
# 2016-04-16 Adjust TV Guide from a SQL file
# If using service.rytecepgdownloader and selecting Danish - you can set the first 11 channels to use with a file with theese lines (SQLadjustTVguideExample.sql)(The AQL file is only executed if channel0 is different from firstchannel in the file!:
firstchannel=DR1

#            You can make recursive recordings. The text in the recording is searched in the TV Guide you have chosen.

#     You can now restore a backup of your recordings database. When you start or stop Kodi, the database with recordings and recursive recordings are saved.
#     From a new view you can select a previous database to be restored. When you select a database, the working database is saved, all recordings are deleted/stopped. The selected database is set as the active database and the reschedule function is activated.
#     Recursive updates run once after 1 minute and every 45 minutes. Every 2 hours a search in favourites or all channels is performed.
# 2015-02-07 The date is now not just today, when modifying a recording
# 2015-02-05
#     The database used to store recordings is copied each time you restart the Kodi with NTV-Krogsbell Add-on. The backup is placed together with the actual database in the userdata folder - addon-data and plugin.video.ntv...
#     You can switch to a backup version by stopping Kodi and replace the file in use. If you delete the database in use, you just start with an empty database.

#     Not all platforms are handled yet. The following platforms are handled with this version: Platform: Windows NT x86 32-bit, Linux x86 32-bit, Linux x86 64-bit and Android ARM 32-bit
#     You can see your platform on the recording part of the settings page. If your platform is different from the above three, please raport to the forum with your platform and platform you must select to make recording work.
#     If there should be problems with the automatically setting of platform, it can be disabled by setting the Debug Recording flag.
# 2015-02-03 Searching for Recursive recordings can now be as original just the selected channel, search all favorite channels or all My Channels.
#     When updating from the Planned Recordings view, by selecting a recursive recording will only search the original channel.
#     Note that the time to search depends on the number og recursive recordings, the number of favorite channels and last the number of My channels.
#     The search for recursive channels is started after 1 minute and then each 2.5 hours
#     A setting will control if you want notifications during the search for recursive recordings
# 2015-01-28 From Mikey1234 - Set the execute flag when needed

# 2015-01-04 Created at function that can translate old icons to the new channels - to be removed when NTV.mx is updated or reduced to few icon changes. Table must be configured with new and old channel numbers. To use the table set the general addon parameter 'Use 2014 Icon' = true
# 2014-12-26 Tested version 3.4.1 with Kodi 14.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - Recording still not working and icons on old channel numbers - otherwise nothing found.
# 2014-12-22 --live and --stop commands are put back in the recording command - still recording not working
# 2014-12-21 Filename of recording again contains <cat>_<channel name> like: 413_DR1 HD

#     New parameters in the setup are introduced under recording and setting.
#     The Planned Recording view now shows the recording progress and any problem of abrupt recording.
#     If the quality of the recorded channel drops, recording stops. The recording will then be retried for a number of times, resulting in extra files in the recordings view.
#     The recorded view is now sorted with the newest recordings in the top, regardles of your os
#     Recordings with 'Stop Recording' in filename will be deleted if possible, whenever recursive recordings are tested.
#     Recordings view will now show folders and have a menu iten to open folders. Opening recordings view will always start from where files are recorded.

#     RECORD
#        If you select record from the TV Guide view, the selected program is set to be recorded and it is checked, that the required timeslot is free.
#        If you select fram the Channels view, the program is normally already started, so you are asked for start date (default today), start time, stop date(watch out if you pass midnight), stop time and finally the title of the program.
#        With this feature, you can set to record any program at any time.
#        It is found that the channel DK1 HD has no TV Guide, but shows a better quality than the channel DK1. So if you setup recording on DK1, you will actually record DK1 HD.
#        Recordings do not stop automatically. This version has implemented a funtion, where a recording is started after the planned recording. This recording is marked Stop recording: and the title of the original recording. If you have set the end time wrong - you are lucky as the recording continues on the same channel, but in a new file. You can stop a recording by watching a channel and accept the warning - STOP RECORDING!
#     RECORD RECURSIVE
#        Used from the TV Guide view to mark a program that you always want to record. You should immediately use Modify Record, to change the title of the recording to the textstring, that is in the TV Guide each week. If you want to record Formula 1, select the channel TV3 Plus and find a program with Formula 1 in the titel and select  Record Recursive. Then select Modify Record and change the titel from Formula 1: Russia to just Formula 1. The search is immune to upper/lowe case.
#        The Record Recursive is set to search the TV Guide each second hour and during restart for programs on this channel containing the title.
#        The recursive recording is searched in reverse order of the time when the recording is created og modified. If you have a more importent recursive recording, just modify it to search it before the other. Why is that - when you search recursive recordinge, the found programs are set for recording if the timeslot is free - If not the recording is marked passive and shown in blue.
#     MODIFY RECORD
#        If you want to prolong the recording time to include two adjacent programs, just modify the recording. Before you modify a recording, you should delete the Stop Recording for the program.
#        If you modify a recursive recording, you will only be asked for the name/search title as start/stop times are of no relevance for recursive recordings.
#     DISABLE RECORD
#        If you have recursive recording that makes a recording, that you do not want, mark it Disabled. A new search of recursive programs will not enable it again and the time slot can be used for other programs.
#        To release a disabled recording, just modify it.
#        Disabled recordings are marked orange.
#     DELETE RECORD
#        Any record that you do not need any more - just delete it.
#        Records are only shown if they are for today and in the future or are recursive recordings. When you restart the XBMC/Kodi only visible records are restores - all older records are remover from the database.
#        If you delete an active recording do not stop the recording. To stop the recording just show a program.
#        If you have an active recording your XBMC/Kodi will not exit until you on Windows go to the Joblist and stop the process rtmpdump.exe(32 bit)
#     Planned Recordings
#        This wiew shows the planned recordings and the definition of the recursive recordings.
#        The planned recordings ar shown for all of today. The recordings that have been executed are shown in pale white, the others with yellow time. An active recording is shown in red.
#        Recordings in blue are recursive recordings, that are inactive as there were no avalable time slot.
#        Recordings in orange are disabled recordings
#     Recorded
#        Just switch to the view that shows the recorded programs. If you place eg. .mp4 files in this folder, they can be shown with the recorded programs.
#        Recorded programs have filenames as: [2014-10-18 20-01] - 188_TV_2_Charlie - Doc Martin.flv
#                                             [Start time]       - channel number and channel name - title of program and .flv as extension
#     Toggle Favourites

#        Views are sorted by channel name
#     Refresh
#        Refresh the view you are in.
#        If you are in the Planned Recordings view and have selected a recursive recording - the TV Guide will be searched for recursive recordings and the view is refreshed. The search is always executed at the start of XBMC/Kodi and each following two hours.
#
#     During restart of XBMC/Kodi all planned and recursive recordings are activated again. Agent to maintain recursive recordings are started.

# 2014-10-12 Recordings that are not allowed are marked blue. they can be activated by modifying the record.
#     Recursive recordings can be marked wit a leading * - When you modify a Recursive recording, the TV Guide will be searched for part of the title in the selected channel
